I am making a fantasy baseball statistics website. I will have a navigatable stats database where you can view every team and their players to see each players stat lines. Teams and players will be manually added and their stats and records will be randomly generated. The only data that is required is their non-stats info (name, team, jersey number, etc.). I'll need a data table for players that will have a team id attatched to each player. There will also be a team table. When a player or team is submitted, the stats will be generated and submitted into the same table at the same time. Full CRUD capability will be available. The Add new player/team pages will have an edit page counterpart. Stats will not be editable. I will probably end up adding extra features such as favoriting teams or players, or generating a new year of stats for a team or player.
