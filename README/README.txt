Fantasy Baseball Statistics lets you add teams and players to a database. The teams have a storage of champ wins and win/loss record. Players are added to a team, their rookie and last years are inputted manually, and then stats for every year are generated randomly. You are able to add years to each player. You are also able to play a game where you choose two teams to play each other, decide if it is a world series game or not, and then the winner and loser will be chance. The chance is determined by who has a better runs scored and runs allowed difference. The team with the better difference has a 3/5 chance of winning, while the lesser team has a 2/5 chance. The score of the game is random, and each team's win/loss record will update accordingly to the results. If it was a world series game, the winning team's champ wins goes up by 1.
